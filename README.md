# Crostian
Crostianized methods for everyday uses.

No need to say that this package is just a joke. All I want is to compile all the stupid things my friend [Cristian aka. Crostian](https://github.com/Pitus660) says and make him feel ashamed.

# Using crostian module
```python
from crostian import crostiada

@crostiada
def your_function():
  return 'hey'
```
# Q&A
### Can I use @crostiada to decorate all my methods?
Of course! If you want to make all your work completely useless go ahead!

### Does crostian module provides any useful function?
No, sorry.
